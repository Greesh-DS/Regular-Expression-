# Regular-Expression

Extracting all the numbers with orange color background from the text below:

{"orders":[{"id":1},{"id":2},{"id":3},{"id":4},{"id":5},{"id":6},{"id":7},{"id":8},{"id":9},{"id":10},{"id":11},{"id":648},{"id":649},{"id":650},{"id":651},{"id":652},{"id":653}],"errors":[{"code":3,"message":"[PHP Warning #2] count(): Parameter must be an array or an object that implements Countable (153)"}]}

The code is written using regular expression module caleed as re, which is used to work with a sequence of characters that forming a search pattern.

In this code as we are not able to show the background color of the digits as mentioned in the question, I used a for loop to get the exact numbers from the text given above.
